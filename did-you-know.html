      <strong>What was the first Surah revealed in the Qur’an?</strong><br>
      <em>Answer: Surah Al-Alaq (Surah 96), Verses 1–5</em>
    </p>

    <h2>📖 Revelation Background</h2>
    <p>
      The first revelation from Allah ﷻ to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ came in the **Cave of Hira** near Makkah, during the sacred month of Ramadan. The Prophet ﷺ was 40 years old and used to meditate in solitude, reflecting on the Creator and the state of his people.
    </p>

    <h2>🌟 The Verses Revealed:</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>
        1. Read in the name of your Lord who created.<br>
        2. Created man from a clot.<br>
        3. Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous—<br>
        4. Who taught by the pen—<br>
        5. Taught man that which he knew not.
      </strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>📝 Explanation:</h2>
    <p>
      These verses from Surah Al-Alaq mark the beginning of divine revelation and signify the importance of **knowledge (‘ilm)** in Islam. The command “Iqra” (Read!) shows that Islam is a religion deeply rooted in literacy, learning, and reflection.
    </p>

    <p>
      The verse “Created man from a clot” highlights the humble origin of man, reminding us of our dependence on the Creator. It also signifies the miracle of life created from a simple substance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The phrase “Taught by the pen” draws attention to the **value of writing and preserving knowledge**. It was through the pen that knowledge was spread, laws were written, and civilizations advanced.
    </p>

    <p>
      The revelation was a moment of awe and intensity for the Prophet ﷺ. When Jibreel (Gabriel) came to him in the cave and asked him to read, the Prophet ﷺ replied, “I cannot read.” The angel repeated the command thrice, after which the first five verses were revealed.
    </p>

    <h2>💡 Significance:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This was the **first communication from Allah** to mankind after a long period of silence since Prophet Isa (Jesus) عليه السلام.</li>
      <li>It defines the beginning of the **final message** and the rise of the **Seal of the Prophets**.</li>
      <li>It placed emphasis on **reading, education, and enlightenment** — core Islamic values.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Surah Al-Alaq reminds us that knowledge is sacred, and with it comes responsibility. The more we learn, the closer we should get to humility and submission to Allah.
