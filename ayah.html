    <p class="arabic">فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا</p>

    <h3>Explanation:</h3>
    <p>
      This verse is one of the most comforting and hopeful messages in the Qur'an. It reminds believers that:

<h4>difficulty is accompanied by relief.</h4> 

The Arabic word "maʿa" (with) is very important—it means that ease doesn’t come after hardship only, but actually comes along with it.<br>

In fact, Allah mentions this twice in Surah Ash-Sharh, in verses 5 and 6, to emphasize it:<br>
<h3>“Indeed, with hardship comes ease.” (v.5)
“So, surely with hardship comes ease.” (v.6)</h3>


<h5>Key Islamic Lessons:<br>
Allah’s Mercy is Greater than Hardship:</h5>
Allah promises that no hardship is without ease. He never burdens a soul more than it can bear. This verse is a reminder that trials are temporary, but Allah’s help is constant.<br>
<h5>
One Hardship, Two Easings:</h5>
Scholars of Tafsir (Qur'anic explanation) point out that the word "al-ʿusr" (the hardship) is definite (with "al"), while "yusr" (ease) is indefinite, which in Arabic implies two eases.
So the meaning is: With every one hardship, there are at least two eases.<br>
<h5>
Reassurance to the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:
</h5>
This Surah was revealed to give comfort to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ during a time of great struggle and opposition in Makkah. Allah was telling him: hardship is temporary—success and relief are coming.
<br><br>
<h5>
A Lesson in Patience and Trust:
</h5>
The verse teaches us to stay patient and keep trusting Allah in hard times. Even when we cannot see the light, this verse assures us that it exists.
<br>
<h5>
Practical Takeaway for Us:
</h5>

If you are going through anxiety, loss, failure, or any trial—this verse is for you.
<br>
<h5>Remind yourself:</h5>


“This pain is not forever. Allah is with me. He will bring relief.”
<br><br>

This mindset gives strength, hope, and peace to a believer.
<h2>
Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said:
</h2>
"Know that victory comes with patience, relief with hardship, and that with every difficulty comes ease."
