      <strong>“Smile at your brother — it's a charity!”</strong><br>
      <em>(Tirmidhi)</em>
    </p>

    <h3>Explanation:</h3>
    <p>
      This beautiful Sunnah reminds us of the profound simplicity and power of a smile. In Islam, even the smallest acts can carry immense spiritual rewards when done with sincere intention. Smiling is a form of **Sadaqah (charity)** — it costs nothing but can brighten someone’s day and spread positivity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was known for his kind nature and cheerful face. Companions reported that he would often smile when meeting others, spreading warmth and love in every gathering. In a world full of stress and sadness, your smile can be a source of healing and hope.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scientifically too, a smile releases endorphins — natural feel-good chemicals that reduce stress and improve mood. From a spiritual perspective, this Sunnah builds brotherhood, strengthens relationships, and promotes harmony in the Muslim community.
    </p>

    <p>
      So next time you see someone, remember: a genuine smile is not just politeness — it's worship. Follow this Sunnah, and spread light in the lives of others, one smile at a time.
